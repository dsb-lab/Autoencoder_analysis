This repository contains the code and documentation for the Autoencoder analysys project, which is a part of the master's thesis of Omar Anoud Blanco. 
The project explores the analysis of bacterial growth populations by the use of a PCA, an autoencoder neural network (AE) and a variational autoencoder neural network (VAE). 
These machine learning algorithms are used for dimensionality reduction, data reconstruction and data generation purposes.

Master’s Thesis of Modelling for Science and Engineering, Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).

All these codes were written in Python programming language.
